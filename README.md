[WordPress][wordpressurl] plugin enabling ability to send invites to users to create accounts. Heavily inspired by WPShrike's [Invitation Based Registrations](https://wordpress.org/plugins/invitation-based-registrations/) but due to code style, unnecessary features and inconsistent interface I have written this whilst learning from WPShrike's plugin.

## Requirements

A working installation of [Wordpress][wordpressurl], v1.0.0 of the plugin has been tested with Version 5.2.4 but should work on many versions. Built for use with PHP 7.0 onwards, 5.6 although untested should work.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release zip file or clone repository.
2. Place in /wp-content/plugins/ directory
3. Log in to Wordpress administration page:
  1. Go to 'Plugins';
  2. Enable plugin 'Accudio Invite Users';
4. For options and to invite users go to 'Users' > 'Invite Users'

## Version History
